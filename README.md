# OTTR Template for Websites

This is my first website published with the ITCR OTTR template.

OTTR Websites will be checked for:

- Check for spelling errors more intensively than RStudio and allow you to add words to the dictionary
- Check for broken links - you will be warned about broken links

Website files will also be automatically rendered remotely. This will be triggered when a pull request is merged with a change to files that might influence the contents of your website.

To learn more about how this site is created see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) and [here](https://garrettgman.github.io/rmarkdown/rmarkdown_websites.html).
